# Mongolian Font Builder

## Overview

Mongolian Font Builder is a comprehensive toolchain for constructing, shaping, and testing Mongolian script fonts. It provides a Python package, detailed documentation, and structured data to support font development and testing.

## Tooling

The core Python package, `mongfontbuilder`, is located in the [lib/](lib/) directory. It includes utilities for font construction, shaping rule implementation, and data processing.

The [tests/](tests/) directory contains examples and test cases. While it is not part of the package, it can be referred to when writing code.

To install the package (can be done using PowerShell or any terminal):

```powershell
pip install mongfontbuilder
```

## Documentation
