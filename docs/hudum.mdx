**Isolated <Mong written="Ị" /> and isolated <Mong written="Ụ" />**. Isolated <Mong written="Ị" /> and isolated <Mong written="Ụ" /> are used historically, with examples shown in [(Dorji _et al._, 2017)](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17035r2-mongolian-std-var.pdf). In some Traditional Mongolian literature, even if the letter _n_ before isolated <Mong written="Ị" /> or <Mong written="Ụ" /> is omitted, the left point is retained and therefore has to be consistently analyzed as belonging to _i_, _u_ or _ü_.

**Final <Mong written="I" /> in letter _j_**. Final <Mong written="I" /> in letter _j_ is introduced in [(Dorji _et al._, 2017)](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17035r2-mongolian-std-var.pdf), where the written form of _j_ in the example _bui–j·a_ is not final, but isolated. Since there are currently no examples exist to prove its existence, the written form is marked in gray, but the shaping process still supports the theoretical existence of a word with final <Mong written="I" /> in letter _j_ and chachlag.

**Medial <Mong written="II" /> in letter _y_ and medial <Mong written="O" /> in letter _w_**. Medial <Mong written="II" /> in letter _y_ and medial <Mong written="O" /> in letter _w_ are introduced in [(Dorji _et al._, 2017)](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17035r2-mongolian-std-var.pdf), where the written form <Mong written="II" /> of letter _y_ in the examples _ayl_ and _aymag_, and the written form <Mong written="O" /> of letter _w_ in the example _tawlay_ are all differences derived from letter analysis. Since _ail_, _aimag_ and _taulai_ are preferred, these written forms are marked in gray.

**Letter _ḳ_ (<Mong written="K2" />) and letter _k_ (<Mong written="K" />)**. Letter _ḳ_ in form <Mong written="K2" /> is used to represent /kʰ/ (Latin: k) in Hudum literature in China, while letter _k_ in form <Mong written="K" /> is used to represent /kʰ/ (Cyrillic: к) in Hudum literature in Mongolia. The reason for disunifying the two letters is that Hudum Ali Gali uses <Mong written="K2" /> to record /ɡ/ and uses <Mong written="K" /> to record /kʰ/.

**Medial <Mong written="Ħ" /> in letter _ħ_ and initial <Mong written="Ž" /> in letter _ž_**. Medial <Mong written="Ħ" /> in letter _ħ_ and initial <Mong written="Ž" /> in letter _ž_ are similar, so they are unified in proposals such as [(SAH, 2017)](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17035r2-mongolian-std-var.pdf). The reason for disunifying the two written units is that Hudum Ali Gali uses <Mong written="Ħ" /> to record /ɦ/ and to indicate aspiration, and uses <Mong written="Ž" /> to record /ʈ/.
