## Hudum

**Comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013)**. Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER NA MEDIAL SEPARATE FORM for the letter _n_. This presentation form is used as the initial <Mong written="N2" /> in Todo _n_, which is never used in Hudum. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Hudum part of this document.

More importantly, the naming principle for written forms used by Quejingzhabu (2013) differs significantly from this document, for example, naming the initial <Mong written="A" /> of the letter _a_ as the “third medial” form of the letter _a_. This is because it names the written form based on its position in the Mongolian word, where the front of chachlag and particles are not considered word boundaries. So the reason it says a written form is “medial” is because it is not preceded or followed by a word boundary. However, this document defines “medial” as joined both forward and backward.

**Comparison with GB/T 25914—2010**. This document contains all the written forms of all the letters in GB/T 25914—2010 and can be regarded as an implementation of it.

**Comparison with GB/T 25914—2023**. This document contains all the written forms of all the letters in GB/T 25914—2023 and can be regarded as an implementation of it.

**Comparison with Liang (2019)**. This document uses the shaping progress framework of Liang (2019) and presents the written units, phonetic letters, and logic of the shaping process in the same format. The main difference is that this document introduces positional default forms, fully uses dictionary-based particle shaping logic, and adds shaping rules as required by GB/T 25914—2022; whereas Liang (2019) uses fallback forms instead of default forms in the shaping progress, minimizes the use of dictionary-based particle shaping logic, and does not include these additional shaping rules.

## Todo

**Comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013)**. Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER NA THIRD MEDIAL FORM for the letter _n_. This presentation form is used as the final <Mong written="N" /> in Hudum _n_, which is never used in Todo. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Todo part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER TODO LONG VOWEL SIGN FINAL FORM for the letter _ƚ_. This presentation form consists of a chachlag and a long vowel sign, and is part of the ligatures like _baƚ_, _paƚ_ and so on. Since the behavior of the long vowel sign when added to a ligature is considered similar to a combining mark, the chachlag is not considered to be part of the long vowel sign, and thus this written form is not included.

**Comparison with GB/T 36649—2018**. This document contains all the written forms of all the letters in GB/T 36649—2018 and can be regarded as an implementation of it.

## Sibe

**Comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013)**. Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER YA SECOND INITIAL FORM for the letter _y_. This presentation form is used as the medial <Mong written="I" /> in Hudum _y_, which is never used in Sibe. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Sibe part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE I THIRD FINAL FORM for the letter _i_. This presentation form is used as the final <Mong written="Ï" /> in Manchu _i_, which is never used in Sibe. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Sibe part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND INITIAL FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND MEDIAL FORM for the letter _z_. These presentation forms are used in the upper part of Sibe ligature _zi_, which is never used alone in Sibe. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Sibe part of this document.

The presentation form MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZHA MEDIAL FORM for letter _ž_ in Quejingzhabu (2013) is a <Mong written="J2" /> form with a ring on the right. However, examining today’s Sibe newspapers, books and dictionaries, this form has changed, so it is not included in the Sibe part of this document.

**Comparison with GB/T 36641—2018**. GB/T 36641—2018 introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND INITIAL FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND MEDIAL FORM for the letter _z_. These presentation forms are used in the upper part of Sibe ligature _zi_, which is never used alone in Sibe. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Sibe part of this document.

## Manchu

**Comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013)**. Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SA THIRD FINAL FORM for the letter _s_. This presentation form is used as the final <Mong written="S3" /> in Manchu Ali Gali _s_, which is never used in Manchu. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Manchu part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ANG FINAL FORM for the letter _ŋ_. This presentation form is used as the final <Mong written="AG3" /> in Sibe _ŋ_, which is never used in Manchu. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Manchu part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND INITIAL FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND MEDIAL FORM for the letter _z_. For the same reasons as in the previous section, these written forms are not included in the Manchu part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZHA MEDIAL FORM for the letter _ž_. This presentation form is different from the final <Mong written="J̊" /> in Manchu _ž_, so this written form is not included in the Manchu part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER MANCHU I SECOND MEDIAL FORM for the letter _i_. This presentation form is used as the medial <Mong written="AI" /> in Sibe _i_, which does occur in Manchu literature, but is regarded as a non-normative writing variant, so this written form is not included in the Manchu part of this document.

**Comparison with GB/T 36645—2018**. GB/T 36645—2018 introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND INITIAL FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND MEDIAL FORM for the letter _z_. For the same reasons as in the previous section, these written forms are not included in the Manchu part of this document.

## Hudum Ali Gali

**Comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013)**. Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A SECOND ISOLATE FORM for the letter _a_. This presentation form is a stylistic toothed variant of the isolate <Mong written="A" />, so this written form is not included in the Hudum Ali Gali part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A FINAL FORWARD FORM for the letter _aX_. This presentation form is used in the Hudum Ali Gali ligature, and is equivalent to the final <Mong written="A" /> of letter _a_, so this written form is not included in the Hudum Ali Gali part of this document. For the same reason, both MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI NGA INITIAL SHORT FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI NGA MEDIAL SHORT FORM are not included either.

**Comparison with GB/T 25914—2010**. For the same reasons as in comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013) in this section, the MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A SECOND ISOLATE FORM, MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A FINAL FORWARD FORM, MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI NGA INITIAL SHORT FORM, and MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI NGA MEDIAL SHORT FORM are not included in the Hudum Ali Gali part of this document.

**Comparison with GB/T 25914—2023**. For the same reasons as in comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013) in this section, the MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A SECOND ISOLATE FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A THIRD FINAL FORM are not included in the Hudum Ali Gali part of this document.

Since the shaping step for MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A SECOND FINAL FORM is quite clear, this document adds the shaping step for this form.

## Todo Ali Gali

**Comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013)**. Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER TODO ALI-GALI I TA. This letter is not used in the Todo Ali Gali, thus not included in the Todo Ali Gali part of this document.

**Comparison with GB/T 36649—2018**. GB/T 36649—2018 introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER TODO GA SECOND FINAL FORM. This presentation form is used as the initial <Mong written="N" /> of letter _n_, but since it is analyzed as the letter _g_, this document analyzes it as the initial <Mong written="Ĥ" /> of letter _g_.

GB/T 36649—2018 introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER TODO GA THIRD FINAL FORM. This presentation form is the stylistic variant of the MONGOLIAN LETTER TODO GA FIRST FINAL FORM, and thus is not included in the Todo Ali Gali part of this document.

GB/T 36649—2018 introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI PA THIRD INITIAL FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI PA THIRD MEDIAL FORM. These presentation forms record different phonemes with MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI PA SECOND INITIAL FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI PA SECOND MEDIAL FORM, and thus are analyzed as the variant of _pʰX_ in this document.

GB/T 36649—2018 introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI HALF U SECOND MEDIAL FORM. This presentation form is not used in the Todo Ali Gali, thus not included in the Todo Ali Gali part of this document.

## Manchu Ali Gali

**Comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013)**. Quejingzhabu (2013) does not add the feminine forms for the letters _tX_ and _dʰX_, this document adds the feminine forms for the letters _tX_ and _dʰX_.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI I SECOND FINAL FORM. This presentation form is equivalent to the final <Mong written="Ï" /> of letter _i_, so this written form is not included in the Manchu Ali Gali part of this document.

**Comparison with GB/T 36645—2018**. For the same reasons as in comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013) in this section, the MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI I SECOND FINAL FORM is not included in the Manchu Ali Gali part of this document.
