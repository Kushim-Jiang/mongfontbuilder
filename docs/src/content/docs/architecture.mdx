Each writing system using Mongolian script and the unified writing system formed by integrating them have the same architecture of text representation and text shaping. The text representation and text shaping rules contained in the individual writing systems and the integrated writing system are the concrete realization of this common architecture. This chapter describes this common architecture, and subsequent chapters describe the specific rules of each writing system in detail.

## Data files and the standard toolchain

The text shaping data for Mongolian script are in the form of machine-readable files that provide the character attribute information, text shaping rules, font generation program, and font testing program for Mongolian script.

The character attribute information and text shaping rules of Mongolian script provide the correspondence between Mongolian characters and variants in each writing system, and the correspondence between Mongolian character strings and glyph sequences. The font generation program is capable of completing and generating a usable font by providing the basic design file, the correspondence information between glyph images and variants, and the setting information. The font testing program can test how the font supports each writing system by providing the font file and the correspondence between glyph images and variants.

## Character set

The characters included in each writing system of the Mongolian script can be categorized into Mongolian-specific characters and characters shared with other scripts.

### Phonetic letters and written units

Due to the introduction of _matres lectionis_, for the writing systems using Mongolian script, both vowels and consonants of the written language correspond to the actual texts, and both are similar in behavior and equal in status. Therefore, although the original writing system was abjad, each writing system using Mongolian script has the characteristics of an alphabet.

These writing systems, with the characteristics of both abjad and alphabet, result in two ways of analyzing and encoding the Mongolian script. One is to determine the graphemes used by each writing system by chronologically comparing Mongolian script with Old Uyghur script and Old Turkic script, and to identify each grapheme as a character; the model formed by this method is called the _graphetic model_, and the basic unit in this model is called the _written unit_. The other is to analyze the phonemes of the written language recorded by the writing system, to group together the glyphs that record the same phoneme, and to identify each phoneme as a character; the model formed by this method is called a _phonetic model_, and the basic unit in the model is called the _phonetic letter_.

The specification used in this manual is based on the phonemic model, in which the characters correspond to the phonemes of the written language as recorded in the writing systems, with some compromises to maintain relative stability with the existing system. For example, the final <Mong written="Ï" /> in Manchu records the phoneme /ɹ̩/, is the same as the phonetic letter _ï_, but because it corresponds to ⟨i⟩ rather than ⟨y⟩ in the Möllendorff transcription, it is treated as corresponding to the phonetic letter _i_ rather than _ï_. This analysis is inherited in this specification.

#### Multi-to-one and one-to-multi confusion

Since the writing units and the phonemes do not have a one-to-one correspondence, the phenomenon of the same phoneme corresponding to more than one written unit and the same written unit corresponding to more than one phoneme may occur. For example, in Hudum, the phonemic letter _n_ is usually written as <Mong written="N" /> when it appears as an onset and as <Mong written="A" /> when it appears as a coda (except for loanwords such as <Mong written="SWK2OIND" />); and the grapheme sequence <Mong written="AORDU" /> may correspond to _ordo_ “palace”, _urtu_ “long”, and _urdu_ “south”.
