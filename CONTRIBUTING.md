[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

Once youâ€™ve installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a local development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Starlight looks for .md or .mdx files in [docs/](docs/). Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to [web/src/assets/](web/src/assets/) and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in [web/public/](web/public/).
