## Hudum

**Comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013)**. Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER NA MEDIAL SEPARATE FORM for the letter <Mong locale="MNG" links="n"/>. This presentation form is used as the initial <Mong locale="TOD" links="N"/> in Todo <Mong locale="TOD" links="n"/>, which is never used in Hudum. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Hudum part of this document.

More importantly, the naming principle for written forms used by Quejingzhabu (2013) differs significantly from this document, for example, naming the initial <Mong locale="MNG" links="A" /> of the letter <Mong locale="MNG" links="a" /> as the “third medial” form of the letter <Mong locale="MNG" links="a" />. This is because it names the written form based on its position in the Mongolian word, where the front of chachlag and particles are not considered word boundaries. So the reason it says a written form is “medial” is because it is not preceded or followed by a word boundary. However, this document defines “medial” as joined both forward and backward.

**Comparison with GB/T 25914—2010**. This document contains all the written forms of all the letters in GB/T 25914—2010 and can be regarded as an implementation of it.

**Comparison with GB/T 25914—2023**. This document contains all the written forms of all the letters in GB/T 25914—2023 and can be regarded as an implementation of it.

**Comparison with Liang (2019)**. This document uses the shaping progress framework of Liang (2019) and presents the written units, phonetic letters, and logic of the shaping process in the same format. The main difference is that this document introduces positional default forms, fully uses dictionary-based particle shaping logic, and adds shaping rules as required by GB/T 25914—2022; whereas Liang (2019) uses fallback forms instead of default forms in the shaping progress, minimizes the use of dictionary-based particle shaping logic, and does not include these additional shaping rules.

## Todo

**Comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013)**. Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER NA THIRD MEDIAL FORM for the letter <Mong locale="TOD" links="n" />. This presentation form is used as the final <Mong locale="MNG" links="N" /> in Hudum <Mong locale="MNG" links="n" />, which is never used in Todo. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Todo part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER TODO LONG VOWEL SIGN FINAL FORM for the letter <Mong locale="TOD" links="lvs" />. This presentation form consists of a chachlag and a long vowel sign, and is part of the ligatures like <Mong locale="TOD" links="b a lvs" />, <Mong locale="TOD" links="p a lvs" /> and so on. Since the behavior of the long vowel sign when added to a ligature is considered similar to a combining mark, the chachlag is not considered to be part of the long vowel sign, and thus this written form is not included.

**Comparison with GB/T 36649—2018**. This document contains all the written forms of all the letters in GB/T 36649—2018 and can be regarded as an implementation of it.

## Sibe

**Comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013)**. Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER YA SECOND INITIAL FORM for the letter <Mong locale="SIB" links="y" />. This presentation form is used as the medial <Mong locale="MNG" links="I" /> in Hudum <Mong locale="MNG" links="y" />, which is never used in Sibe. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Sibe part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE I THIRD FINAL FORM for the letter <Mong locale="SIB" links="i" />. This presentation form is used as the final <Mong locale="MCH" links="Iy" /> in Manchu <Mong locale="MCH" links="i" />, which is never used in Sibe. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Sibe part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND INITIAL FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND MEDIAL FORM for the letter <Mong locale="SIB" links="z" />. These presentation forms are used in the upper part of Sibe ligature <Mong locale="SIB" links="z i" />, which is never used alone in Sibe. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Sibe part of this document.

The presentation form MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZHA MEDIAL FORM for letter <Mong locale="SIB" links="zr" /> in Quejingzhabu (2013) is a <Mong locale="SIB" links="J2" /> form with a ring on the right. However, examining today’s Sibe newspapers, books and dictionaries, this form has changed, so it is not included in the Sibe part of this document.

**Comparison with GB/T 36641—2018**. GB/T 36641—2018 introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND INITIAL FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND MEDIAL FORM for the letter <Mong locale="SIB" links="z" />. These presentation forms are used in the upper part of Sibe ligature <Mong locale="SIB" links="z i" />, which is never used alone in Sibe. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Sibe part of this document.

## Manchu

**Comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013)**. Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SA THIRD FINAL FORM for the letter <Mong locale="MCH" links="s" />. This presentation form is used as the final <Mong locale="MCHx" links="S3" /> in Manchu Ali Gali <Mong locale="MCHx" links="s" />, which is never used in Manchu. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Manchu part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ANG FINAL FORM for the letter <Mong locale="MCH" links="ng" />. This presentation form is used as the final <Mong locale="SIB" links="A G3" /> in Sibe <Mong locale="SIB" links="ng" />, which is never used in Manchu. Therefore, this written form is not included in the Manchu part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND INITIAL FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND MEDIAL FORM for the letter <Mong locale="MCH" links="z" />. For the same reasons as in the previous section, these written forms are not included in the Manchu part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZHA MEDIAL FORM for the letter <Mong locale="MCH" links="zr" />. This presentation form is different from the final <Mong locale="MCH" links="Jc" /> in Manchu <Mong locale="MCH" links="zr" />, so this written form is not included in the Manchu part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER MANCHU I SECOND MEDIAL FORM for the letter <Mong locale="MCH" links="i" />. This presentation form is used as the medial <Mong locale="SIB" links="A I" /> in Sibe <Mong locale="SIB" links="i" />, which does occur in Manchu literature, but is regarded as a non-normative writing variant, so this written form is not included in the Manchu part of this document.

**Comparison with GB/T 36645—2018**. GB/T 36645—2018 introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND INITIAL FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER SIBE ZA SECOND MEDIAL FORM for the letter <Mong locale="MCH" links="z" />.

## Hudum Ali Gali

**Comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013)**. Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A SECOND ISOLATE FORM for the letter <Mong locale="MNGx" links="a" />. This presentation form is a stylistic toothed variant of the isolate <Mong locale="MNGx" links="A" />, so this written form is not included in the Hudum Ali Gali part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A FINAL FORWARD FORM for the corresponding character. This presentation form is used in the Hudum Ali Gali ligature, and is equivalent to the final <Mong locale="MNGx" links="A" /> of letter <Mong locale="MNGx" links="a" />, so this written form is not included in the Hudum Ali Gali part of this document. For the same reason, both MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI NGA INITIAL SHORT FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI NGA MEDIAL SHORT FORM are not included either.

**Comparison with GB/T 25914—2010**. For the same reasons as in comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013) in this section, the MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A SECOND ISOLATE FORM, MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A FINAL FORWARD FORM, MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI NGA INITIAL SHORT FORM, and MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI NGA MEDIAL SHORT FORM are not included in the Hudum Ali Gali part of this document.

**Comparison with GB/T 25914—2023**. For the same reasons as in comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013) in this section, the MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A SECOND ISOLATE FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A THIRD FINAL FORM are not included in the Hudum Ali Gali part of this document.

Since the shaping step for MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI A SECOND FINAL FORM is quite clear, this document adds the shaping step for this form.

## Todo Ali Gali

**Comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013)**. Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER TODO ALI-GALI I TA. This letter is not used in the Todo Ali Gali, thus not included in the Todo Ali Gali part of this document.

**Comparison with GB/T 36649—2018**. GB/T 36649—2018 introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER TODO GA SECOND FINAL FORM. This presentation form is used as the initial <Mong locale="TODx" links="N" /> of letter <Mong locale="TODx" links="n" />, but since it is analyzed as the letter <Mong locale="TODx" links="g" />, this document analyzes it as the initial <Mong locale="TODx" links="Hp" /> of letter <Mong locale="TODx" links="g" />.

GB/T 36649—2018 introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER TODO GA THIRD FINAL FORM. This presentation form is the stylistic variant of the MONGOLIAN LETTER TODO GA FIRST FINAL FORM, and thus is not included in the Todo Ali Gali part of this document.

GB/T 36649—2018 introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI PA THIRD INITIAL FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI PA THIRD MEDIAL FORM. These presentation forms record different phonemes with MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI PA SECOND INITIAL FORM and MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI PA SECOND MEDIAL FORM, and thus are analyzed as the variant of <Mong locale="TODx" links="p" /> in this document.

GB/T 36649—2018 introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI HALF U SECOND MEDIAL FORM. This presentation form is not used in the Todo Ali Gali, thus not included in the Todo Ali Gali part of this document.

Quejingzhabu (2013) introduces MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI I SECOND FINAL FORM. This presentation form is equivalent to the final <Mong locale="MCHx" links="Iy" /> of letter <Mong locale="MCHx" links="i" />, so this written form is not included in the Manchu Ali Gali part of this document.

**Comparison with GB/T 36645—2018**. For the same reasons as in comparison with Quejingzhabu (2013) in this section, the MONGOLIAN LETTER ALI-GALI I SECOND FINAL FORM is not included in the Manchu Ali Gali part of this document.
